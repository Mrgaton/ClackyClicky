# ClackyClicky

Welcome to ClackyClicky, a program that simulates the sound of a mechanical keyboard. Every time you press a key, you'll hear the satisfying click of a mechanical switch.

I created this program for fun, so please forgive me if the code isn't perfect. I'm always open to improvements and suggestions, so feel free to open an issue if you have any ideas or encounter any problems.

Thanks for checking out ClackyClicky!
